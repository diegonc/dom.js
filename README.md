# Tower Server DOM

A DOM implementation for Node.js using Google's Gumbo (HTML5 Parser written in C).

## Initial Requirements

These are the initial requirements for this module.

* Implement the basic DOM specification (Implement more functionality as we need it).
* Solid & Simple API
* No Memory Leaks(!)
* Fast (thanks to Gumbo)

## Install

NPM:

```
npm install tower-server-dom
```

## Usage

Require it:

```js
var dom = require('tower-server-dom');
```

Parse some HTML:

```js
dom('<html></html>');
```

Get a document object:

```js
var document = dom('<html></html>').document;
```

Get a window object:

```js
var window = dom('<html></html>').window;
```

Serialize the DOM:

```js
var document = dom('<html><div id="hello"></div></html>').document;
var string = document.childNodes[0].outerHTML;
```


## API

```js
var dom = require('tower-server-dom');
```

### dom(html, options);

Returns an object containing `document` and `window` properties.

```js
dom('<html></html>', {}); // options are currently not used.
```

## Issues

The goal of this module is to be 100% spec compliant. However, it's not there yet. If you have any bugs either send a pull request, or simply open a new issue.

To be clear: Gumbo is 100% compliant, but Gumbo is not intended to be a mutable DOM parser. Thus, this module is converted to a mutable tree. This module is simply missing some mutable functions that come with the DOM. The DOM tree itself is fully compliant.

## Testing

We use mocha for all the tests.

```
mocha
```
